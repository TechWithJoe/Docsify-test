Jekyll ius a Static site generator that is known for being simple, stattic, and perfect for Blogging. With the use of the commnad line, you can use the Jekyll programming to use specific commsands for structuring your site. Jekyll is big into using liquid templating as well.

## 11ty
Eleventy is a Static site generator. Very similar to Jekyll, but known for being a tad simplier. Unlike Jekyll, 11ty works with more template languages, and works well with your projects existing directory structures.

## Docsify > alternitives
While these arlternatives may have some different features over docsify, Docsify still beats these softwares in a couple of catagroies. First, I persoanlly think docsify is the easiest to leaqrn out of these threem however that may be subjective. Another reason to use docsify is because of the multiple themes they give you. This helps add more customization to the page. Docsify is just very simple and lightweight.
